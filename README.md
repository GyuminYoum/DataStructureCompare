# DatatStructureCompare
comparison between multiple data structures in terms of speed
data structures compared: Doubly Linked List, Linear probing hashmap,Quadratic probing hashmap, Hashchain.
Chrono class: Allows us to measure time in desired unit
The project allowed me to see the visual difference in speed when working with different data types and what advantages one data structure has over others.
main language: c++
